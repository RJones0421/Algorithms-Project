# Algorithms-Project

This is my final project code for my Analysis of Algorithms undergrad class.

We were tasked to find the number at an index 2/3 of the way through the array using three different algorithms (Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, and Randomized Select.
The program runs generates 5 different sets of random numbers for each increment (ranging from 10,000 to 200,000 numbers) to find the average run time.
The program will print the number the algorithm found to the console with each row representing the same starting array.
(First column represents Insertion Sort, the second is Heap Sort, and the third is Randomized Select).
At the end, the program will find the average time taken in milliseconds and display it to the console.
